        It is this focus on complexity 
        that leads into one of the defining 
        facets of Giliane’s work – her use of pattern. 
        The vast majority of Giliane's projects
         are defined by their busy, overcrowded aesthetic, 
         and the designer's real skill lies in her 
         intuitive ways of making these pieces make sense. 
         This approach is apparent in her posters for 
         the RKC concert hall in Switzerland. Close up, 
         the posters look like a pleasing, yet slightly 
         incomprehensible set of dense patterns; it is 
         only upon moving further away from the posters 
         that you begin to see the outline of 
         the letters 'R', 'C' and 'K' emerge.
